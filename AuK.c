   produced in bit 0 of the file register pointed by the first parameter.
   If this bit was 0 (non locked) the function
   replays with a 0 in its second parameter (W1), otherwise it replays with 
   a 1.
   The result of calling this function is set to 1 (locked in 
   any circumstance) the bit 0 of file register pointed by the first 
   parameter.

   TEST and SET operation is executed in only one instruction cycle.
   Therefore, it is uninterrumpible, hence it is impossible for race
   conditions to appear in relation to the bit in which TEST and SET 
   operates.
